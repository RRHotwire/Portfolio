Project 2 - Card Guessing Game
This project is to design a game center. We will be including the card guessing game and 
the number guesssing game. First we will ask for the user's input to pick which game they 
would like to play. After the user chooses the game, it will launch an object creating the
game they wish to play. Once done the program will deconstruct the object and will prompt 
the user to play again.
