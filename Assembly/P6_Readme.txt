Lab Objectives
The objective for this lab is to learn how to interface with more complex hardware components on the Dragon12+ EVB.  You will read instructions about protocols and interfaces with sensors and/or output devices and learn how to write code to work with one or more components.

Work Task
In this lab you will choose to interface with one or more complex hardware components.  Choose among the LCD display, the buzzer/speaker, the light sensor, the temperature sensor, the serial port (communication with the HyperTerminal), the infrared (IR) transmitter/receiver, the DAC (digital to analog converter), etc.  In the previous labs we have interfaced with the pushbuttons and LEDsâ€”you can also use these in your project for this lab.

First decide what hardware component(s) to interface with.  Then choose a lab project that is centered around using the component(s).  For example, if you decide to interface with the buzzer/speaker, instead of just sounding the buzzer/speaker, choose to do something more involved such as outputting different tones or notes (e.g. A-G) depending on which button(s) are pressed.  Or, if you decide to use the IR receiver, instead of just receiving a signal on the IR receiver, choose to do something more involved such as using the IR receiver to detect object distance and display a number on the LEDs which approximately corresponds to how many centimeters away the object is from the IR receiver.

You may work independently on this lab project, or with one partner (to form a team of two).  You may choose to interface with multiple complex hardware components.  If you correctly interface (if your program works) with multiple hardware components, then you will receive an extra 20 points per component.
