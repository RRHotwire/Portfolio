PART II
Using the exact same method as described above design the followings.
5-input OR gate with A, B, C, D, E as inputs and F as output:
• Create the truth table and show it on the report
• For entity name use: “the first 4 letters of your first name” followed by “5-input-OR”
• For architecture name use “the first 4 letters of your last name” followed by “OR5”
• With 5 inputs your force command timing should cover enough time for all possible
input logic combinations.
• For “MIR” please include all outputs as shown in the sample in Part I.
