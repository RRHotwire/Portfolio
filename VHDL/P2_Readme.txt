1. Circuit 1: Design a circuit that provides the 2's complement at its output for each 3-bit signed
binary number applied at its input.
• Use the input signals X, Y, and Z and the corresponding output signals F1, F2, and F3.
• Use an output signal V which is set to 1 if the output signed number results in an over
overflow, and 0 otherwise.
• Use only AND, OR, and NOT gates.
• Your report must show:
i. The truth table of the circuit
ii. The Boolean equations for each of the output signals as function of the input
signal(s)
iii. The circuit schematic diagram
iv. The complete VHDL code
v. The complete VHDL simulation screen captures
vi. Your comments (what have you learned from this exercise? what were the
challenges, and how did you overcome those challenges?
2. Circuit 2: Design a circuit that provides the majority of 1s circuit such that its output signal F is 1
when a majority of the input signals X, Y, and Z are 1.
• Use only AND, OR, and NOT gates.
• Your report must show:
i. The truth table of the circuit
ii. The Boolean equations for the output signal F as a function of the input signals
iii. The circuit schematic diagram
iv. The complete VHDL code
v. The complete VHDL simulation screen captures
vi. Your comments (what have you learned from this exercise? what were the
challenges, and how did you overcome those challenges?
