Tasks:
Given the circuit: 1(, , ) = .
+ . 
Assuming:
• tPLH = tPHL = 120ns for OR gates
• tPLH = tPHL = 110ns for AND gates
• tPLH = tPHL = 80ns for INVERTER
Instructions and Report details:
1) Submit the truth table for F1(X,Y,Z) .
2) VHDL Dataflow Design Style:
a. Draw the circuit for the Dataflow Design Style showing the input , output pin names, all internal
signal names used to represent the delayed version of the original signals, as well as all internal
wiring and the logic components.
b. Design 3 separate and complete design versions of VHDL with the timing delays above using
each of the Dataflow Design Styles listed below. Include a VHDL test bench in each design to
provide the stimuli for the inputs X, Y, Z.
Submit the complete VHDL code listing and wave screenshots showing all input and output
signals for:
i) Dataflow style using Boolean equation with test bench. Did the result match the truth table?
ii) Dataflow style using CSAs with test bench. Did the result match the truth table?
iii) Dataflow style using SSAs with test bench. Did the result match the truth table?
3) Behavioral Design Style:
Design F1 with the timing delays above using Behavioral Design Style. Include a test bench in the
design to provide the stimuli for the inputs X, Y, Z.
Submit complete Behavioral Design Style VHDL code listing and simulation screenshots showing all
input and output signals. Did the result match the truth table?
4) Using VHDL Structural Design Style:
a. Draw the F1 circuit for the Structural Design Style showing the input, output pin names, all
internal signal names used to represent the delayed version of the original signals, as well as all
internal wiring and the logic components.
b. Design F1 with the timing delays above using Structural Design Style. Include a test bench in the
design to provide the stimuli for the inputs X, Y, Z.
Submit complete Structural Design Style VHDL code listing and simulation screenshots showing
all input and output signals. Did the result match the truth table?
